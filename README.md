**Sign Language to Speech **

**ABSTRACT** 
This paper presents a Sign Language to Speech system designed to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments. 
Leveraging Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Teras, our real-time application captures sign language gestures through a webcam, processes them using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and converts the recognized signs into audible speech. 
The system aims to bridge the communication gap by providing a seamless and instantaneous translation of sign language into spoken language.

**INTRODUCTION**
The deaf and hard-of-hearing community faces challenges in communication, particularly in environments where sign language interpreters may not be readily available. 
This project addresses this issue by developing a system that translates sign language gestures into spoken language in real-time.
Develop a real-time sign language recognition system. 
Integrate the recognition system with a text-to-speech engine for auditory output. 
Provide an accessible and user-friendly solution for individuals with hearing impairments.

**DEPENDENCIES**
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
Teras (Note: Assuming you meant TensorFlow)

**SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**
The system captures video input from a webcam, pre-processes the frames, feeds them into a pre-trained CNN for sign language recognition, and converts the recognized signs into speech using a text-to-speech library.
**Video Input:** Captured through OpenCV, frames are continuously fed into the system.

**Pre-processing:** Frames undergo resizing, normalization, and other preprocessing steps to match the requirements of the sign language recognition model.

**Sign Language Recognition Model:** A pre-trained CNN, implemented using TensorFlow, classifies the pre-processed frames into corresponding sign language gestures.

**Text-to-Speech Synthesis:** The recognized signs are converted into audible speech using a text-to-speech library (e.g., pyttsx3).

**MODULES:**
1. Data Acquisition:
The data Acquisition is collection of relevant data sets that can be used for training and testing the model.
The data set collected must have specific hand gestured and its associated relevant text.

2. Palm image Extraction:
A video file is a collection of images. We can look at it as if video is text data, then images are characters. Extracting images (also called frames) from videos is important for various use cases such as image processing, analyzing a part of video in detail, video editing and much more. OpenCv is used for extraction of image frames from a video.The next step in this is to identify a palm in the image.

3.Sign Detection and text determination:
The framework provides a helping-hand for speech-impaired to communicate with the rest of the world using sign language. This leads to the elimination of the middle person who generally acts as a medium of translation. This would contain a user-friendly environment for the user by providing speech/text output for a sign gesture input. The text would be determined based on the training sets provided.

4.Text to speech:
There are several APIs available to convert text to speech in Python. One of such APIs is the Google Text to Speech API commonly known as the gTTS API. gTTS is a very easy to use tool which converts the text entered, into audio which can be saved as a mp3 file. Here we would be using the pyaudio to convert text to speech.

**APPLICATION AND FUTURE WORKS**
A. Application

The dataset can easily be extended and customized according to the need of the user and can prove to be an important step towards reducing the gap of communication for dumb and deaf people.
Using the sign detection model, meetings held at a global level can become easy for the disabled people to understand and the value of their hard work can be given.
The model can be used by any person with a basic knowledge of tech and thus available for everyone.
This model can be implemented at elementary school level so that kids at a very young age can get to know about the sign language.

B.  Future Scope
The implementation of our model for other sign languages such as Indian sign language or American  sign     language.
Further training with large dataset to efficiently recognize symbols.
Improving the model's ability to identify expression

**CONCLUSION**
The fundamental goal of a sign language detecting system is to provide a practical mechanism for normal and deaf individuals to communicate through hand gestures. 
The proposed system will be used with a webcam or any other in-built camera that detects and processes indicators for recognition.
We may deduce from the model\'s findings that the suggested system can produce reliable results under conditions of regulated light and intensity. 
Furthermore, new motions may be simply incorporated, and more images captured from various angles and frames will supply the model with greater accuracy. 
As a result, by expanding the dataset, the model may simply be scaled up to a vast size. The model has some limitations, such as environmental conditions such as low light intensity and an unmanaged backdrop, which reduce detection accuracy. 
As a consequence, we\'ll attempt to fix these problems as well as expand the dataset for more accurate findings.
